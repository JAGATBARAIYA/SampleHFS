<p>It is very important to recollect that you didn&rsquo;t lose your hair overnight. It was a process that involved your natural ageing process coupled with hormonal changes and hereditary issues. And this happened over time.</p>

<p>The same is true for regrowing your hair. For some people, it may take upto 4 Months of continued, regimented usage, to start seeing results that could be satisfactory.</p>

<p>Here is a quick look at what you could expect in successful cases*:</p>
</div>

<div class="weeks">
<h2>First Few Weeks</h2>

<p>There is an increase in your A/T ratio. This simply means more hair starts getting into Anagen or Growth phase. Hair in transition or resting phase could fall out as the follicle&rsquo;s new growth cycle begins.</p>

<h2>6 to 12 Weeks</h2>

<p>At this stage, reactivation of miniaturized hair follicles starts and would result in the start of regrowth of these resting follicles.</p>

<h2>3 to 6 Months</h2>

<p>At this stage, successful cases will start seeing visible results with fuller, thicker and stronger regrowth.</p>

<h2>Continued Usage</h2>

<p>Continue to use HFS to maximize and maintain your results.</p>

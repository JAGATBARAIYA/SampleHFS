<p>Its called Androgenetic Alopecia (AGA) for a reason. In simple words, you are losing hair due to : Andro &ndash; the result of Androgens and your sensitivity to it&nbsp; and Genetic &ndash; you&rsquo;re just simply genetically predisposed to it.</p>

<h2>This complexity affects you in more than one way :</h2>

<ul>
	<li><a href="#">DHT Sensitivity:</a>

	<p>Certain follicles become sensitive to your naturally occurring hormones, which causes miniaturization of these follicles, leading to gradual replacement of large, pigmented hairs (terminal hairs) by barely visible, depigmented hairs (vellus hairs) in affected areas.</p>
	</li>
	<li><a href="#">Follicular Fibrosis:</a>
	<p>Increased DHT hardens the root by forming debris around hair follicles and preventing blood circulation.</p>
	</li>
	<li><a href="#">Inflammation:</a>
	<p>The DHT sensitivity also causes micro-inflammation and itching. Treating micro-inflammation is critical in addressing hair loss.So, mere growth enhancers will never work.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Any hair regrowth regime should not only enhance growth, but also aim to address all these above issues.</p>

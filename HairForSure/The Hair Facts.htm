<h2>100,000 Hair Follicles at birth.</h2>

<p>This is all we have throughout our lives, with no new follicles growing on our scalp afterwards. That is why, as we step into adulthood, the density of our hair gets reduced as the scalp expands, but the number of hair follicles remain the same.</p>

<div class="life_hair_main">
<h2>Each of these go through repeated cycles of growth, rest and shedding.</h2>

<p>Called the Hair Growth Cycle, each of these follicles undergo repeated cycles of active growth and rest. Hair naturally falls out at the end of the growing period.</p>
</div>

<div class="life_hair_main">
<h2>Abnormal Hair Shedding is called Alopecia.</h2>

<p>Through this growth cycle, everyone loses between 50 to 80 hairs a day. However, some people may start to lose more hair and the number of follicles capable of growing hair decline naturally. This is Alopecia.</p>

<p>Although there are many causes of Alopecia, the most common cause that accounts for 95% of hair loss in men is called &#39;Androgenetic Alopecia&#39; or Male Pattern Baldness.In women, this is characterized by diffused thinning throughout the hair bearing area. Sometimes, the causes and duration of hair loss could be temporary (eg: pregnancy), where its called Telogen Effluvium.</p>
